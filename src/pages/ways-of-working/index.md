First day
    Listen and absorb all the information: Obviously the first day in any job it's always important to listen to the people you will be working with. They will tell you all about the internal systems they use, what state the code is in, and generally how to get up to speed. As a manager, you need to also listen to the off hand comments and what is missing from the conversations. 
    Don't rush into things
    Meet everyone you can

First week
    Have a 1:1 with an agenda for all members
    Learn what the team views as their biggest stregths and weaknesses
    Understand what your manager expects of you

First month
    Ways of working workshop
    OKR's for both you and your team
    Understanding of the roadmap both for the company and for improving the team

Always
