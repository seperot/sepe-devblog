A golden path document is the best way for new starters to come in strong and help those that come after them
<!-- end -->

###What is a golden path document
![Bot](./images/bot.png)
Document that allows someone who has no idea about how any system works to be able to release code live

###How to structure it

Start with the basics, what do you need to do the job, hardware software etc
Then move to access so they can make sure they can progress early
Then go into how you write code, any specifics on a team style, headers they need set and even rules like TDD and unit test coverage.
Then go into how to grab work, explain your teams way of being agile. Do you use Kanban, Scrum, who needs to do what when a ticket moves?
Next how your pull requests work, do you have rules on size? Do you need certain things put into the description for automated pipelines? Rules about comments and when to take them to a conversation
Finally how to release the code, What to do when the PR is done, how to get it to live. Do they need to make release notes?

###Make it living

Making it living is simple, just as they work through it encurage them to edit anything in the document they found as a pain point, something outdated that you had to explain to them or just something they feel like needs more detail. Part of the team.
