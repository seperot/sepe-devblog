A golden path document is the best way for new starters to come in strong and help those that come after them

###What is a golden path document
![Bot](./images/bot.png)

A Golden path, when talking about software is the ideal route for a user to take. In the case of a shopping app, the golden path would see the user log in, find the item they are looking for easily, go to checkout, and pay all without any issue. A golden path document is similar in that it's the ideal path but this time for a new member of the team to get up and running with the project quickly and easily. The document shouldn't assume much as you don't know where someones starting point or gaps in their knowledge will be. For someone it may be they have never used the CI software your team uses but for someone else it could be they have no idea what to install as their previous company had strict installation rules.

###How to structure it

__*Start with the basics*__
The first thing is for them to check they have all the hardware they will need. 
* Is their workstation the minimum spec? 
* Do they need peripherals or cables? 
* Do they need access to devices they need for debugging? 
* Is their any accessability items they don't know they can ask for?

Next is software, same deal but this time 
 what do you need to do the job, hardware software etc
Then move to access so they can make sure they can progress early
Then go into how you write code, any specifics on a team style, headers they need set and even rules like TDD and unit test coverage.
Then go into how to grab work, explain your teams way of being agile. Do you use Kanban, Scrum, who needs to do what when a ticket moves?
Next how your pull requests work, do you have rules on size? Do you need certain things put into the description for automated pipelines? Rules about comments and when to take them to a conversation
Finally how to release the code, What to do when the PR is done, how to get it to live. Do they need to make release notes?

###Make it living

Making it living is simple, just as they work through it encurage them to edit anything in the document they found as a pain point, something outdated that you had to explain to them or just something they feel like needs more detail. Part of the team.
